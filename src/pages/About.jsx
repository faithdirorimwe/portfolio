                         A dedicated web developer with a passion for leveraging technology to tackle real-world challenges. During my time at Uncommon.org, I had the opportunity to acquire valuable skills in building <span>responsive websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS.</span> I also honed my abilities in debugging and problem-solving techniques.
                            <br /> <br />
                            Currently, I am expanding my knowledge by delving into the fundamentals of <span>Java, PHP, Laravel, algorithms, and data structures</span>  as part of my ongoing internship. By mastering these languages and frameworks, I aspire to excel in the dynamic software industry.
                            <br /> <br />
                            With a blend of technical expertise and a genuine enthusiasm for making a positive social impact, I am committed to utilizing my skills to address the challenges faced by marginalized communities. My background in sociology further fuels my drive to create meaningful change and improve the lives of those around me.
                            <br /> <br />
                            I am driven by the desire to make a meaningful impact in the tech sector and contribute to changing the world through my abilities. I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead and look forward to collaborating on innovative projects that push the boundaries of technological advancement.

                        I'm truly delighted to be a part of uncommon.org's Youth Coding program. I have the unique chance, as a volunteer, to instruct students from marginalized backgrounds in game coding. It's really gratifying to see their delight and see their smiles widen as they use code to create something wonderful. These children gain useful skills from the Youth Coding program, which also provides them with possibilities in the future.
